    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A goal is a predefined milestone which you hope to achieve.
A system is a process through which you reliably achieve results.
This essay focuses on the difference between the two and seeks to outline why you should move away from task oriented goal seeking behaviour.
Instead, I propose that more emphasis should be placed upon the system, although a feedback loop linking it with results is a requisite.</p>

<p>Goals, to do lists, tasks, desired outcomes, milestones.
There are many named for what is essentially a simple result.
Yet, how often do we achieve these desired outcomes?
For many people, they seem to live by them, to put all of their time into a structured existence with no spare moments scheduled.
No spontaneity, no relaxation, no inspiration.
Just a list of tasks to complete.</p>

<p>This is not to denigrate what we all need to do each day.
Every person has things they desire, that they wish to achieve in a diverse range of fields.
All of these goals are subjectively worthy, and who am I to objectively cast light on them anyway.
But the issue remains that once the task has been completed there remains the problem of what to do next.</p>

<p>In my view, it is of more benefit to the individual to undertake a systemic approach instead of the task oriented approach.
In a systemic approach the completion of tasks are beneficial side effects, not the main result.
The main result is entirely trivial and simple.
To raise a simple example, if your goal is to write a novel and preliminary system would be to simply write for an hour a day on any topic which interests you.
See if you can write at least that and not lose interest in the art, do not present yourself with a monolithic entity which will intimidate you.</p>

<p>The goal based approach would be to focus upon the end result, and then break down the perceived pathway into a number of smaller goals.
Repeat ad infinitum until the desired discreteness has been achieved and then begun.
The primary issue with this approach is the lack of humility regarding the perceived pathway.
Unless this is a task which you have completed many times before then it is probable that you have no idea what the actual pathway is.
As you progress down the path there were be many forks, many dead ends and reversals, switch backs as well as regions where the path simply does not exist.
By locking yourself in to a fixed approach you may have prevented any yourself from achieving the desired outcome.</p>

<p>Instead, undertake some research and develop a System which will help you achieve a similar result.
The actual end result may not be identical to what was first envisioned.
But this is merely reflective of a greater understanding of the aforementioned path.
What is important is that by trusting in a well designed system when strife arises there is a fall back option.</p>

<p>The key when attempting to develop such an approach is the right balance between generality and specificity.
For example, to continue our writing example above the system of writing every day may not get you anywhere near writing a novel, instead you may simply end up with hundreds of poorly connected musings, such as this blog.
Instead, a systemic approach would be to focus upon writing <em>and</em> a small sub goal.
This sub goal is not major, instead it is a minor point which acts as a target.
For example, the sub goal could be to work on character development, or plot development.</p>

<p>In an effort to not drum along the theoretical and philosophical line too much I would like to present a number of examples.</p>

<p>To consolidate the writing example, instead of setting a goal to write a novel/book/whatever.
Set up the system of writing each day, and gradually refine this material into a consolidated whole.
There are many situations when prose and witty dialogue could be reused from an earlier piece of work, see Hollywood.
But do not get too attached to any one piece of work.</p>

<p>In the realm of physical fitness, instead of setting the goal to Squat 250kg build up a system around continuous squatting.
Program in appropriate rest breaks and be aware that a linear progression won&rsquo;t occur.
Time, practice and experience are all needed to reach such a goal.</p>

<p>If attempting to lose weight instead of setting a target goal, choose a structured plan preferably one with flexibility.
Don&rsquo;t attempt to lose 10kg, instead, take a 80:20 or 90:10 based approach to a specific diet and exercise plan.
You cannot iron out the little kinks until you have the larger fundamentals locked down.
If you&rsquo;re not taking in enough water and protein to begin with nothing else really matters at that stage.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re attempting to learn programming instead of a generic monolithic goal set yourself the task of making at least one meaningful commit to github each day.
Then, Seinfeld that approach and don&rsquo;t break the chain.
You need to code, and read other peoples code in order to improve and this will take time.
You cannot learn a major new skill and method of thinking in ten easy steps.
Such approaches teach you syntax without structure and are potentially detrimental.</p>

<p>If you want to be a cleaner person then don&rsquo;t periodically do a major clean of your living space.
Instead, set the system of doing at least one cleaning task every day, of at least five minutes.
You&rsquo;d be surprised how easy it is as long as you keep on top of it.</p>

<p>If you want to become a serious hiker, focus upon getting out and doing a hike each weekend before planning a major week long excursion or the Appalchian trail.
If you can&rsquo;t handle the small ones then there is no way you&rsquo;ll be able to handle the monsters.</p>

<p>Hopefully this gives you enough examples to construct your own systems.
I&rsquo;m not attempting to spoon feed the approach, merely to make a semi convincing argument that the systemic approach is better than a hard goal based approach.
Do your research, think about what your desired outcomes are and design your systems accordingly.
Don&rsquo;t be afraid to take into account appropriate feedback characteristics, but be aware of the time lags involved.
For example, it will take at least a month to assess the merits of a diet and exercise based system, potentially longer.
Don&rsquo;t give up on the system when your desired outcome doesn&rsquo;t occur immediately.</p>
