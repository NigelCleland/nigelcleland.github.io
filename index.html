  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been experimenting lately with custom cookie cutter templates for developing python projects.
Now, what is a cookie cutter template?
Well, it&rsquo;s a simply template which capitalises upon the excellent cookiecutter tool developed by Audrey Roy.
What the tool does is use jinja2 templates in order and a .json file in order to create a basic outline of a project.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So a brief update it most likely due, it has been a substantial period of time since I lost wrote a post.
Although no-one reads this blog so that is all perfectly fine.
Since my last post I&rsquo;ve travelled round Europe for a few weeks, presented at a conference, hit some gym PR&rsquo;s and worked on some exciting elements.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So Bittorrent Sync is the newest offering from BitTorrent and I must say I am in love. Broadly, it allows you to synchronise folders between multiple computers quickly and easily. In this way it is very similar to Dropbox and other equivalents (Drive, SkyDrive, Box, iCloud) etc. Now those other services have their own lists of benefits and negatives which I&rsquo;m not going to cover here. Instead, this post is about BitTorrent Sync.</p>

<p>First, Bittorrent has been given a bit of a bad rep in recent years due to its proliferation in the use of internet piracy. However, such a use is technology agnostic and a number of other individuals and companies are using BitTorrent for entirely legitimate purposes. Simply, it reduces the requirement for centralised servers for downloading and sharing files between multiple people. In effect, cutting down on costs and bandwidth requirements for people who have many large files to share.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A brief command to incorporate an image as part of a chapter heading, and position it so that it makes sense. This took about 30 minutes of googling to pull together the appropriate pieces, not a great use of time but I learnt a couple new LaTeX tricks while I was doing it so that&rsquo;s all good.</p>

I&rsquo;ve never done web dev before and it has been an interesting learning experience so far. I&rsquo;m going to create a fairly simple tracking app for the gym etc, basically get a Database set up and some logging going on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Haven&rsquo;t been able to write as much as I would have liked to over the past week. Been a bit tied up with other things going on. Thus, I thought I&rsquo;d take this opportunity to run through each of the various projects and research lines I&rsquo;m going down at the moment. Hopefully this should be a bit of an overview as to what I actually do.</p>

<p>Broadly I&rsquo;ll divide my projects into three categories, write up stage, in progress stage and backburner stage. A project in write up stage is currently undergoing final revisions before submission to journals/conferences etc. Ones in the in progress stage are what I&rsquo;m currently actively developing. This includes a lot of experimentation and prototyping to help consolidate my thoughts. Finally, the ones on the backburner stage are those which I&rsquo;m currently thinking about and will tackle when I get time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a researcher you&rsquo;ll often have to conduct a lot of smaller experiments, testing out a hypothesis here, running some data analysis there. Yet a lot of people I know, and I am personally guilty of this as well, do not make these scripts repeatable. Writing smart, testable, repeatable code takes longer and for many researchers who code out of necessity, not out of love it is not as intuitive. In many undergraduate degrees, particularly in engineering, the goal throughout the course of study is more to finish the assignment, pass the paper and repeatability be damned.</p>

<p>However, this behaviour becomes counterproductive once you start researching. I cannot imagine the number of hours I have wasting having to repeat useless boiler plate, hard coded examples when some intelligent preparation work, although taking a bit longer initially would save me far more time in the long run.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post will cover some quick usage surrounding merging a Series and a DataFrame or merging two Series together. This is functionality which I&rsquo;ve often felt is lacking and is boiler plate I&rsquo;ve had to write a number of times. I&rsquo;ve added the functionality to my new repo <a href="github.com/NigelCleland/pdtools">pdtools</a> and should hopefully simplify life for other people.</p>

<p>This post will be a simple explanation as to how it works as well as a brief explanation. Broadly, as some of my work I had to work with extremely large datasets, tens of millions of rows, dozens of columns the full works. I had to merge aspects of these datasets together, often from disparate data sources. one element which was particularly frustrating for me was having large numbers of duplicate columns, and irrelevant information when all I wanted was a single series.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the second instalment in a brief series on using the pandas library for data analysis. The general aim of this series to to highlight some of the cool functionality which is in pandas. None of this is revolutionary, however Wes McKinney and the other contributors have made exceptional contributions to the speed and ease of which it is completed.</p>

<p>In this post I&rsquo;m going to over the groupby function. Highlight a couple of the interesting things which you can do with it and generally show how much simpler pandas makes it to accomplish data analysis. I&rsquo;m going to be using a real data set, hydrology data from the last 80 odd years for the New Zealand electricity grid, this dataset has approximately 30,000 data points (1 per day) and is therefore a good size for this work. This post will cover a brief example of using groupby for time series and won&rsquo;t go through any of the more complex functionality and usage which can be developed when working with full DataFrames.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As part of my job I need to do a large amount of sample analysis, and visualisation of small subsets of data. This requires a large quantity of iteration, trial and error and repetitive coding. Something we all wish we could avoid, yet sometimes can&rsquo;t. To give a practical example, I often need to work with half hourly data, for a wide range of individual metrics which may have similarities. What I need to do, is isolate this data in various ways.</p>

<p>EDIT: The original post used a library called masks. I&rsquo;ve decided to merge this into a larger directory to be called <a href="http://github.com/NigelCleland/pdtools">pdtools</a>. This directory will contain more helper functions and methods, not just masks.</p>
