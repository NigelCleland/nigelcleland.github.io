I'm currently experimenting with using Flask for a bit of Web Development.
I've never done web dev before and it has been an interesting learning experience so far. I'm going to create a fairly simple tracking app for the gym etc, basically get a Database set up and some logging going on.

<!-- more -->

Once this is done, I'll try and extend it and get some fancier features going on, visualisations etc. It will be interesting working with these to see how python can be used in such a fashion. May end up dictating some of the other work I do as well which I may want to expose via websites.

This post is currently a work in progress
