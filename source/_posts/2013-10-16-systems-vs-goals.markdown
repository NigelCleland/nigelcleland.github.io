A goal is a predefined milestone which you hope to achieve.
A system is a process through which you reliably achieve results.
This essay focuses on the difference between the two and seeks to outline why you should move away from task oriented goal seeking behaviour.
Instead, I propose that more emphasis should be placed upon the system, although a feedback loop linking it with results is a requisite.

Goals, to do lists, tasks, desired outcomes, milestones.
There are many named for what is essentially a simple object.
You want to achieve or do a particular outcome and/or you want a particular result as a basis from this.
